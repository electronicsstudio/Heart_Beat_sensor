**Monitor the Heart Rate using Pulse Sensor and Arduino**
**Applies BPM formula** BPM = 60 × 1000 / Interval(ms)

The Pulse Sensor is a well-designed, low-power plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for the Arduino. Anyone who wants to incorporate real-time heart-rate data into their work—students, artists, athletes, makers, and game and mobile developers—can benefit from it.
