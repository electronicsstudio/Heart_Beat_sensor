**Applies BPM formula** BPM = 60 × 1000 / Interval(ms)

The APDS-9008 is a low cost analog-output ambient light photo sensor in miniature chipLED lead-free surface mount package.  It consists of a spectrally suited photo sensor, which provides excellent responsivity that is close to the response of the human eyes, as show in figure 2. The APDS-9008 is ideal for applications in which the measurement of ambient light is used to control display back lighting.  Mobile appliances such as the mobile phones and PDAs that draw heavy current from display backlight ing will benefit from incorporating these photo sensor 
products in their designs by reducing power consumption significantly.

The Pulse Sensor is a well-designed, low-power plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for the Arduino. Anyone who wants to incorporate real-time heart-rate data into their work—students, artists, athletes, makers, and game and mobile developers—can benefit from it.
